			 * For the sales and marketing company's newest investment products, you send thousands of personalized letters to the company's existing clients.

			 * Dear Ms. Barros,
			 * As a customer of our Magic Yield offering we are excited to tell you about a new financial product that would dramatically increase your return.
			 * 
			 * Currently, you own 2,975,000.00 shares at a return of 12.75%.
			 * 
			 * Our new product, Glorious Future offers a return of 13.13%.  Given your current volume, your potential profit would be $63,000,000.00.

			 * Here's a quick comparison:
			 * 
			 * Magic Yield         12.75%   $55,000,000.00      
			 * Glorious Future     13.13%   $63,000,000.00
